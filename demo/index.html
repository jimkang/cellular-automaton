  <h1>cellular-automaton</h1>
  <p>This is a demo that uses the <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/cellular-automaton">cellular-automaton Node module</a>.</p>
  <p>This example runs the Game of Life, however, it runs it via <strong>sequential</strong> scheduling rather than the <a href="https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">traditional</a> parallel scheduling, so results will be different. The order in which the cells are processed here is determined by a function that sorts cells from closest to furthest to the top left.</p>
  <h2>The rules of the Game of Life</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>For a space that is 'populated':</b></dt>
    <dd>Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.</dd>
    <dd>Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</dd>
    <dd>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</dd>
  <br />
    <dt><b>For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'</b></dt>
    <dd>Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Legend</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Living cells are represented by circles.</li>
    <li>The acting cell whose rules were just evaluated will have its square highlighted in light yellow.</li>
    <li>Source cells for a rule application (e.g. when a cell becomes populated as a result of a certain number of neighbors, the source cells are the neighbors) are bordered in blue.</li>
    <li>Target cells for a rule application (e.g. when a cell dies as a result of a certain number of neighbors, the dying cell is the target) are bordered in red.</li>
  </ul>
